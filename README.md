# Algorithm Practice

This repository contains my solutions to algorithm and data structure problems, primarily from LeetCode. Each solution is organized for easy reference and future review.

- `.leetcode/` stores numbered solution files.
- Each file corresponds to a LeetCode problem.

## Problem-Solving Approach

- Understand the problem requirements.
- Implement a basic solution first.
- Optimize for time and space complexity.
- Reflect and document key takeaways.

## Problem Log

| ID  | Problem Name                                   | Difficulty | Status | Notes                       |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1   | Two Sum                                        | Easy       | Solved | Review optimal hash map use |
| 2   | Add Two Numbers                                | Medium     | Solved | Linked list manipulation    |
| 3   | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Medium     | Solved | Sliding window pattern      |

_This table will be updated as new problems are solved._

## Future Plans

- Add brief explanations for each problem.
- Tag problems by category (e.g., DP, Graph, Greedy).
- Set up review intervals based on difficulty.

## About

This repository serves as a long-term project to improve my problem-solving skills through consistent practice and structured review.
